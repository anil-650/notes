# Human Population

***"Human population refers to the number of individuals in a particular
area."***

+ The term human population simply would be the number of people thriving in a
  specific area which could range from a village to the world usually. 
+ Additionally, the term is used to describe the inhabitants also but in most
  cases, the term would mean numbers.

The population of early humans is not known to us. But it is assumed that there
would have been only a few thousands of humans when they emerged several years
ago.

The population exploded since the industrial revolution began and the half of
the present population grew since **1950**. The developing countries have the
maximum population.

# What is Population?

+ A discrete assemblage of entities with identifiable characteristics such as
  people, animals with the objective of analysis and data collection is called
  a population. 

+ It consists of a similar group of species who dwell in a particular
  geographical location with the capacity to interbreed. To interbreed,
  individuals in a population must be able to mate with other individuals in
  order to produce fertile offspring.

+ Not all individuals are able to survive and reproduce due to genetic
  variations in them.

+ A local population can be restricted to a smaller area or can occupy a larger
  area,making up for the entire species. 

+ A meta population is when individuals in local populations scatter between
  other local populations.

+ Most of the populations are not stable due to various physical factors
  prevailing in the environment which act as limiting factors against
  exponential growth of the population.
