# Energy Cycle in Ecosystem
1. Water Cycle
water cycle depends on the rain fall.

2. Carbon Cycle
Carbon is the building block of both animal and plant tissue.
Trees keep the carbon in environment in check.

3. Oxygen Cycle
Oxygen is taken in by animals and plants during respiration.
Plants return Oxygen to the environment during photosynthesis.

*P.S. Deforestation is more likely to decrease the overall Oxygen level in air.*

4. Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen making bacteria and fungi breakdown the dead bodies and help plants
to adsorb nitrogen thus completing the food chain.
