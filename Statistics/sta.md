# What is statistics ? Discuss the importance of statistics int the field of management & computer science.
***Statistic is branch of mathematics which deals with the collection of data analysis of data and interpretation of data so statistics is the major interpretation in all type of disciplines.***

- The main aspects of statistics to justify the effectiveness and efficiency of the data interpretation.
- the major characteristics of statistics is basically
1. **Numerical data/facts**
1. **Aggregate of facts**
   - statistics are affected to the market extended by multiplicity of factors 
   - statistics of data refers of measurement of data in complex situation 

     *example:*
    
         bushiness or economics phenomena are 
         vary complex in the sense that there 
         are a large no. of factors operating 
         simultaneously at a given point of time.
     most of the factors ar difficult to apply therefore data collection is the major condition in extend to market.
1. **Standard of accuracy**
1. **Systematic manner / pre determined propose**
1. **Maintain relationship to each other** 

## Numerical data/facts
- Any set of facts can be called as statistics or data
- It can be capable of represent numerically ordinarily the facts can be classified into 2 categories
   ### 1. The facts that are measurable
    Height f a student of a classroom are measurable
in the sense facts are measurable

   ### 2. Facts are not measurable
  In this type of facts are in the form of feel the presence of absence of characteristics
i.e.  honesty color beauty etc.


## Aggregate of facts
- a single numerical figure cannot be regarded as statistics similarly a set of on connected numerical figure turned as statistics.
- statistics means an aggregate of a set of numerical figure which are related to one another.

## Standard of accuracy
   - the characteristics is related to collection of data
   - data are collected by either counting or by measurement of units.
   - When sadistic are obtained by measurement of units in necessary to maintain a reasonable degree standard accuracy it depends on the nature of dependency

## **Systematic manner / pre determined propose**
- Statistics provides relationship to each other


## **Maintain relationship to each other** 

# limitation of statistics
1. Statistics doesn't deal with individual item
1. Statistics deals with quantitative data
1. Statistics laws are only average data 
1. Statistics is liable to be misused
1. Statistics doesn't ravel the entire story

# What are difference between qualitative and quantitative data
*Data means information. statistics always uses the raw data before using the statistical methon its used in redefiend form  
basicaly dtat are classi fied into 4 catagory*
1. Quantitative classification
- based on value or quantity
1. Quantitative classified
 - based attribute or status
1. Temporal classification
- based on time
1. Spatial classification
-  based on location or place

| qualitative data | quantitative data |
|-----------------|------------------|
| is numeric form| is not in numeric form |
| measurable | not measurable |
| provides a fixed result| doesn't provide fixed results |
| deductive in nature | inductive in nature |
| precise and numerical presentation| descriptive in nature |
