## Difference between || & | (binary AND & Bitwise AND)

```c
if(a<b || b<c) //if the 1st statement fails it won't check the 2nd statement
if(a<b | b<c) //both statement will be checked even if the 1st fails
```
## Bitwise << (left shift)
formula: Y=x\*2^s

## Bitwise >> (right shift)
formula: Y=x\\2^s
