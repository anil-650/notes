# 1. What is number system ? Describe all the number system with example

Answer:
The number system is the system of naming or representing numbers. There are various types of number systems in maths like binary, decimal, etc.The value of these numbers depend on the position of the number.

### Binary number system:
+ Consist of 0 and 1
+ Have a base of 2
+ ex: 101 ,(101)<sub>2</sub>

### Decimal number system:
+ Consist of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
+ Have a base of 10
+ ex: 14, (15)<sub>10</sub>

### Octal  number system:
+ Consist of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
+ Have a base of 8
+ ex: 14, (15)<sub>8</sub>

### Hexadecimal number system:
+ Consist of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A(10),B(11),C(12),D(13),E(14),F(15)
+ Have a base of 16
+ ex: AF, (15A)<sub>16</sub>

# 2. Conversion of decimal number to binary number,hexadecimal number and octal number.

Answer:
### How to convert decimal to binary
Conversion steps:
1. Divide the number by 2.
1. Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
1. Get the remainder for the binary digit.
1. Put the bits in reverse high to low order.

ex: 5= 101 or (101)<sub>2</sub>
| Division by 2 | Quotient | Remainder | Bit |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----|
| 5/2           | 2        | 1         | 0   |
| 2/2           | 1        | 0         | 1   |
| 1/2           | 0        | 1         | 2   |

### How to convert decimal to Octal
Conversion steps:
1. Divide the number by 8.
1. Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
1. Get the remainder for the binary digit.
1. Repeat the steps until the quotient is equal to 0
1. Put the bits in reverse high to low order.


ex: 13= 15 or (15)<sub>8</sub>
| Division by 8 | Quotient | Remainder | Bit |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----|
| 13/8          | 1        | 5         | 0   |
| 1/8           | 0        | 1         | 1   |

### How to convert decimal to Hexadecimal
Conversion steps:
1. Divide the number by 16.
1. Get the integer quotient for the next iteration.
1. Get the remainder for the binary digit.
1. Repeat the steps until the quotient is equal to 0
1. Put the bits in reverse high to low order.

ex:20 = 14 or (14)<sub>16</sub>
| Division by 16 | Quotient | Remainder | Bit |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-----|
| 20/16          | 1        | 4         | 0   |
| 1/16           | 0        | 1         | 1   |
