# DEMAND:-

- **Demand is considered as the basis of all productive activities, increase demand of product offers high business prospective for it's future.**
- **Demand implies desire for a commodity backed by ability to & willingness to pay for it.**
- Demand for a commodity it it's quantity which consumers are able and willing to buy at various prices during a given period of time.
- Demand for a commodity always has a reference to price & period of time.
- Producers : produce goods & services.
- Consumers : consume & purchase goods.

## What are the Factors that affect demand ?

1. Taste & preference of consumers.(***Y***)
2. Income of consumers.(***T***)
3. Price of Related goods.(***Pr***)
4. Number of consumers in the market.(***N***)
5. Future price expectation of the consumer.(***F***)

$$Qd(x)=f(Px,Pr,Y,T,N,F,G,A)$$

$$Px=Price of x$$

$$G=Govt. Policy$$

$$A=Advertisement expenditure$$

## LAW Of DEMAND

- According to the law of demand, the factors remaining the same, if price of a commodity falls, quantity demand of said commodity will rise; if price of the commodity rises the quantity demand of said commodity will decrease.
> **There is an inverse and opposite relationship between price and demand.**

### Individual demand schedule

|Price|Quantity demand|
|:---:|:-------------:|
|₹10  |       1       |
|₹5   |       2       |
|₹3   |       5       |
|₹2   |       8       |

### Market Demand Curve

- The Market Demand Curve is the sum total of the Individual Demand Curves.
- The sum total of demand of consumers of that given product at that given time.

| Price  | Consumer A | Consumer B | Consumer C |  Market Demand of               |
|:------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-------------------------------:|
| ₹10    | 1          | 2          | 3          | At price ₹10 market demand is 6 |
| ₹8     | 2          | 3          | 5          | At price ₹8 market demand is 10 |
| ₹5     | 3          | 5          | 8          | At price ₹5 market demand is 16 |

### Exception Cases

- Emergency times
- Necessities of Life (Life saving Meds)
- Speculation (If people are convinced that if a products price going to be very high, they will not bother for the price)

<!--
## Increase and decrease in Demand Curve

### Increase in Demand

- When the demand Curve increase price stays the same (Px is the same).
- It appears when other factors are changed.
-->

## Elasticity of Demand

- Price Elasticity of Demand is used to measure the degree of changes by the help of formula

```
Ep = % changes in QD 
     ------------------
     % changes in Price

= (∆q/q × 100) 
  ------------ [∆q = diffrence in quantity demand & ∆p = diffrence in price]
  (∆p/p × 100)

=  ∆q      p
  ---- × ----
   ∆p      q 
```

### Perfectly Elasticity of Demand

- If the price is more than OP the OQ will go to Zero.
- If the price is less than OP the OQ might increase or decrease to any length
- Ex: if the vegetable vendor selling higher than avg. price you won't buy.
- Small changes in price will bring infinite changes in the Quantity Demand.

### Perfectly En elasticity of Demand

- Irrespective  to price , demand won't be affected.
- Ex: Salt, you won't be more salt or less even if the salt price change.

### Unitary Elasticity of Demand

- When % change in price brings equal changes in Quantity Demand.

### Relatively more Elasticity of Demand

- When % change in price brings more than proportional changes in Quantity Demand.

### Relatively less Elasticity of Demand

- When % change in price brings less than a percentage changes in Quantity Demand.

### Relatively less Elasticity of Demand

- Measuring changes in QD due to changes in Income.
- Degree of responsiveness of QD in response to changes in Income.

```
IE = % changes in QD / % changes in Income
= (∆Q/Q × 100) / (∆I/I × 100) [∆Q = Diffrence in Quantity demand & ∆I = Diffrence in Income]
= ∆Q/∆I × I/Q
```
