## Sets in python

- Set is used to store more than one items in a variable.

- A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable\*, and unindexed.
 - Unordered: every time you execute the program the order may differ.
 - Unchangeable: after you declare set you cannot change them, you can add or remove items.
 - Unindexed: can't be referred by index.
 - Duplicates not allowed.

- Set in python can be declared with `<set name>={"item1","item2","item3"}`

example:

```python
thisset={"apple","banana","cherry"}
print(thisset)
# output
# {'apple','banana','cherry'}
```
