# Pond Ecosystem

The pond is the simplest aquatic ecosystem to observe.

+ There are differences in a pond that is temporary and has water only in the
  monsoon, and a larger tank or lake that is an aquatic ecosystem throughout
  the year. 

+ Most ponds become dry after the rains are over and are covered by terrestrial
  plants for the rest of the year.

When a pond begins to fill during the rains, its life forms such as the algae
and microscopic animals, aquatic insects, snails, and worms come out of the
floor of the pond where they have remained dormant in the dry phase. Gradually
more complex animals such as crabs frogs and fish return to the pond. The
vegetation in the

*"Water consists of floating weeds and rooted vegetation on the periphery which grow on the muddy floor under water and emerge out of the surface of the water."*

As the pond fills in the monsoon a large number of food chains are formed.
Algae is eaten by microscopic animals, which are in turn eaten by small fish on
which larger carnivorous fish depend. These are in turn eaten by birds such as
kingfishers, herons and birds of prey Aquatic insects, worms and snails feed on
the waste material excreted by animals and the dead or decaying plant and
animal matter. They act on the detritus, which is broken down into nutrients
which aquatic plants can absorb, thus completing the nutrient cycle in the
pond. The temporary ponds begin to dry after the rains and the surrounding
grasses and terrestrial plants spread into the moist mud that is exposed.
Animals such as frogs, snails and worms remain dormant in the mud, awaiting the
next monsoon.
