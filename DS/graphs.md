## Graph Theory

+ A graph is pictorial reprentation of any data in organized manner.

+ The graph shows the relation between variable quantities.

+ the graph is made up of vertices (nodes) that are connected by the edges (lines).

+ Famous Swiss mathematician **Leonhard Eular** invented Graph theory. " *with grapes we can minimise various complex math problems* ".

+ A graph is denoted by **G(V,E)** , where
  + **G = Graph**
  + **V = Vertices**
  + **E = Edges**

### Types of Graphs

+ Graphs are divided into two types
  1. Directed graphs
  2. Undirected graphs

1. Directed graphs
  + A directed graph is a graph made up of a set of vertices connected by ages in which the ages half direction.
  + It's a unidirectional graph.
