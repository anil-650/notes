- Boby Taylor : Director of **IPTO** (Information Processing Technique Officer)
at ARPA in **1966**

### 2nd Para

- Internet : Inter Connect Networks
- **1966** : ***Bob taylo**r*, had 3 computer termials connected to ***San Fransisco, Santamonica, Boston***. Each with their own set of cmds : he was frusted by this Which later ledto the creation of **ARPANET**.
- **ARPANET** : *ARPA Network* was based on a technology called ***Packet Switvhing*** , later led to the development of ***TCP/IP***.
- ***TCP/IP*** : *Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol*
- **Protocol** : Protocol is a set of rules to communicate over the  network
- **Tom marill** : is the one bhind calling "Protocols" Protocols, in **1966** in **ARPA**.

> *"The Internet can be defined as a Network of Computers using TCP/IP."*

> *"The Internet is the most important single devlopment to come along scince the IBM PC was introduced in **1981**. It's even more important than the arrival of Graphical User Interface(GUI) .. The internet is a Tidal Wave. It changes the rules."*
> -- Bill Gates, 1995

> [!NOTE]
> Tim Berners Lee created World Wide Web

- **Mark Andreesen** devloped **Mosaic** at *University of Illionis, Champaing Urbana*

- **Telnet** : *Telephonic Net*

> [!NOTE]
> Ethernet : dveloped by Robert Matcalfe & David Boggs at Xerox PARC

- eathernet is a technology where Only one device can talk on the wire at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> **Bandwidth** refers to the *Capacity* of a network

- Bandwidth is usually measured in *Kilo bits per second* (***Kbps***). 1 KB/s = 8 Kbps

  |Bandwidth    |Speed **Mbps**|
  |-------------|:------------:|
  | Narrow band | < 1          |
  | Mid band    | 1-10         |
  | Broad band  | >= 10        |

  The above is nt absolute

- **WAN** : *Wide Area Network* connects networks across diffrent Geographical lcations
- **Router** : A device that sends or routes packets from one LAN to another LAN.

### Packet switching

> [!NOTE]
> ***Circuit switching*** is a thechnique where to transmmit data from A to B, a path is reserved between A-B until the data transmissionis done.

- Packet switching was based on the concept of Circuit switching. It overcame the problems of packect switching by breaking the message into smaller packets and sending it across network on diffrent paths.

#### Important Things about Packets

- Packets are numbered, so they can be reassembledd at the destionation.
- Each packet has the Destination and Source address.
- Packets get sent over the network as capacity(bandwidth) becomes available.
- Packets are forwared across the network and may not follow the same path.
- A single packet is called a **Datagram**
