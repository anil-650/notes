### 1st para

- **1957** : *Sputnik* launch
- Neil Maclroy : Chief Defence Minister, former CEO of Procter & Gamble (parent
        company of tide, head-n-sholders, Pampers etc)
- ARPA : Advanced Research Projects Agency(funding approved in 1958)
- Boby Taylor : Director of **IPTO** (Information Processing Technique Officer)
at ARPA in **1966**
- **Protocol** : In networking, *Protocol* refres to a set of rules for communicating
with devices over the network

### Early Internet in India

- **1991** : Internet came to India via *Satelite*. Two stations were in "Bombay and Kolkata".*(Search JEMS-400 for more)*
- **VSNL** : *Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd* gave out Internet connections, email IDs(@vsnl) through telephone lines.

### 2nd Para

- Internet : Inter Connect Networks
- **1966** : ***Bob taylo**r*, had 3 computer termials connected to ***San Fransisco, Santamonica, Boston***. Each with their own set of cmds : he was frusted by this Which later ledto the creation of **ARPANET**.
- **ARPANET** : *ARPA Network* was based on a technology called ***Packet Switvhing*** , later led to the development of ***TCP/IP***.
- ***TCP/IP*** : *Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol*
- **Protocol** : Protocol is a set of rules to communicate over the  network
- **Tom marill** : is the one bhind calling "Protocols" Protocols, in **1966** in **ARPA**.

> *"The Internet can be defined as a Network of Computers using TCP/IP."*

> *"The Internet is the most important single devlopment to come along scince the IBM PC was introduced in **1981**. It's even more important than the arrival of Graphical User Interface(GUI) .. The internet is a Tidal Wave. It changes the rules."*
> -- Bill Gates, 1995

> [!NOTE]
> Tim Berners Lee created World Wide Web

- **Mark Andreesen** devloped **Mosaic** at *University of Illionis, Champaing Urbana*

- **Telnet** : *Telephonic Net*

> [!NOTE]
> Ethernet : dveloped by Robert Matcalfe & David Boggs at Xerox PARC

- eathernet is a technology where Only one device can talk on the wire at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> **Bandwidth** refers to the *Capacity* of a network

- Bandwidth is usually measured in *Kilo bits per second* (***Kbps***). 1 KB/s = 8 Kbps

  |Bandwidth    |Speed **Mbps**|
  |-------------|:------------:|
  | Narrow band | < 1          |
  | Mid band    | 1-10         |
  | Broad band  | >= 10        |

  The above is nt absolute

- **WAN** : *Wide Area Network* connects networks across diffrent Geographical lcations
- **Router** : A device that sends or routes packets from one LAN to another LAN.

### Packet switching

> [!NOTE]
> ***Circuit switching*** is a thechnique where to transmmit data from A to B, a path is reserved between A-B until the data transmissionis done.

- Packet switching was based on the concept of Circuit switching. It overcame the problems of packect switching by breaking the message into smaller packets and sending it across network on diffrent paths.

#### Important Things about Packets

- Packets are numbered, so they can be reassembledd at the destionation.
- Each packet has the Destination and Source address.
- Packets get sent over the network as capacity(bandwidth) becomes available.
- Packets are forwared across the network and may not follow the same path.
- A single packet is called a **Datagram**

### The Web: 76-79

> [!NOTE]
> The Internet is a network of computers using TCP/IP. The Web is the creation of Tim ***Berners-Lee*** and is based on his major insight to combine hypertext with the already existing Internet.

- **Hypertext** : is a term due to ***Ted Nebon***. It allows a person to read or explore in a *non-linear* fashion by following links to other text, sound or video files.
- Before the Web came into being there were hypertext products in the marketplace, such as **Guide** and **Hypercard**.
- **Tim Berners-Lee** was working at *CERN, a European particle physics laboratory located near Geneva, Switzerland*.
- Berners-Lee realized that it would not be feasible to force the wide mix of researchers at CERN to reorganize their way of doing things to fit a new system. His solution was to marry hypertext with the Internet.
- The World Wide Web consists of three key components, HTTP, HTML, and URL, all developed by Berners-Lee.
- HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is a high-level protocol used to exchange information between a browser and a server.
- The messages sent between the browser and server are either **request** or **response** messages.

> [!NOTE]
> The request message contains information such as the type of browser and operating system, and the body containing data, for example, data entered into a form.

- The response from the server will contain a code indicating that the requested file was found or an error code, header information such as the type of server software, and the body containing the HTML of the requested file.

> [!NOTE]
> - **HTTP Methods:**
>   - **GET:** Requests a specific URL, with an empty body.
>   - **POST:** Used to submit forms, with data included in the request body.

- **HTML:** The language used to display text and graphics on web pages.
- **URL:** The "address" of a web page, following a specific syntax.

> [!TIP]
> Operating system compatibility is irrelevant between browser and server.

- Requires browser (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer) on the client and HTTP server software (e.g., Apache, IIS) on the server.

> [!NOTE]
> **Apache** is the leading open-source HTTP server software.

### Basic Internet Tools: 79-80

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Allows file exchange over the internet.
- **Types of FTP:** (2 types)
    - **Non-anonymous:** Requires account name and password for server access.
    - **Anonymous:** Allows public access to specific server directories.
- **Contrasts with HTTP:**
    - **Connection:** Stays connected to the same server after clicking links.
    - **Content display:** Shows only directory structure, not actual file content.
    - **Server role:** Serves files, not used for computations.

#### FTP is a valuable Tool for Businesses

- **Benefits:**
    1. **Quick and secure file exchange:** Ideal for software distribution, driver updates, document sharing, etc.
    2. **Cost-effective:** Eliminates the need for physical media (e.g., CDs) and postal services.
    3. **Efficient:** Streamlines web development by uploading files directly to the server.
- **Use Cases:**
    1. Software downloads (e.g., after purchase)
    2. Driver updates (e.g., printer drivers)
    3. Document exchange (e.g., purchase orders)
    4. Web development (uploading web pages to servers)
- **Not limited to:** Software companies; applicable to various industries for file sharing and collaboration.
