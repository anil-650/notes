## 1. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6 address system ?

**Difference between IPv4 and IPv6 address system:**

| **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):** | **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):** |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Uses a 32-bit address format. | Uses a 128-bit address format. |
| Supports around 4.3 billion unique addresses. | Supports an enormous number of unique addresses (approximately 3.4×10^38). |
| Address format is expressed in decimal (e.g., 192.168.1.1). | Address format is expressed in hexadecimal (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). |
| Addresses are categorized into classes (A, B, C, D, E). | Eliminates the need for address classes, simplifying routing and address allocation. |
| IPv4 addresses are becoming scarce due to the exponential growth of internet-connected devices. | IPv6 adoption is increasing to accommodate the growing number of internet-enabled devices and address exhaustion issues. |

## 2. Compare between Apple talk & TCP/IP ? (5 points)

**Comparison between AppleTalk & TCP/IP:**

- **Architecture:**
    - **AppleTalk:** Proprietary networking protocol developed by Apple Inc. Primarily used in Apple Macintosh computers and related devices.
    - **TCP/IP :** Open, standardized protocol suite used for internet communication. Comprised of multiple protocols, including TCP, IP, UDP, and others.

- **Functionality:**
    - **AppleTalk:** Designed for smaller, localized networks.
    - **TCP/IP:** Scalable for use in networks of various sizes, from small LANs to global internetworks.

- **Compatibility:**
    - **AppleTalk:** Limited compatibility with non-Apple devices and networks.
    - **TCP/IP:** Widely adopted and interoperable across diverse hardware and software platforms.
    - Standard protocol for internet communication, ensuring compatibility among different systems.

- **Advantages:**
    - **AppleTalk:**
    - Easy setup and configuration within Apple ecosystem.
    - Well-integrated with Apple's graphical user interface.
    - **TCP/IP:**
    - Globally recognized standard for internet communication.
    - Extensively supported by a wide range of hardware and software vendors.

- **Disadvantages:**
    - **AppleTalk:**
    - Limited scalability beyond small, localized networks.
    - Less widely supported compared to TCP/IP.
    - **TCP/IP:**
    - Initial setup and configuration may be more complex.
    - Requires additional software or configuration for some advanced functionalities.


## 3. CERN , what is the full form ? what is their role ?

**CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research):**

- **Full Form:** CERN stands for Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (European Council for Nuclear Research).
    - **Role in Internet Development:**
    - CERN played a significant role in the development of the internet by contributing to the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW).
    - Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN, invented the WWW in 1989 as a way to facilitate information sharing among researchers.
    - CERN provided the infrastructure and environment for Berners-Lee to develop and implement key technologies like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), laying the foundation for the modern internet.
    - Additionally, CERN continues to contribute to internet research and development through projects related to data management, networking, and computing technologies.
